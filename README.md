A counter game mini-project for our Application Development class.
This project focuses on the introduction of React.js

The Game:
  Two players will fight for who will reach the target score first.
  Player 1 has the controls W and S. Player 2 has the controls Up Arrow and Down Arrow.
  Pressing W or Up will increase their score by 1/2/3 (depends on chance). Pressing S or Down will decrease the opponent's score.
  Whoever will reach the target score wins, ending the current game.


Additional Information:
  The players can change their name (default: Ar-rauf vs Imar)
  The target score can be changed (default: 10)
  The attack damage can be changed (default: 5)

System Functionalities:
  A pop-up window will show whenever a player wins, showing the name of the player
  A scoreboard sidebar will record all the names of the players who won (can be toggled on or off)
  A settings sidebar will contain all the fields where the game settings can be changed (can be toggled on or off)
